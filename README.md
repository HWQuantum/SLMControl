# SLMControl
A python library for controlling SLMs using PyQt5

# TODO
- Add in a saving/loading function
  - this could be a right click context menu - right click on any widget to set the defaults/save a set
- Add in the ability to change the lookup table at more points
  - Make a list where more widgets can be added
  - Maybe show the LUT on a little plot
- Work on the opening windows on different desktops (it doesn't work correctly)
- Make the slm windows close when the main widget closes
- Have the ability to reshow the slm windows when closed/hidden
