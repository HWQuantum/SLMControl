* SLMControl
A cross-platform python library for controlling SLMs using (mostly) PyQt5.

Contains a bunch of qt widgets which allow for controlling SLM screens,
setting the lookup tables, setting zernike polynomial corrections,
choosing which desktop they display on, etc...

If want to control two SLMs there's a program already written for that.
Just run SLMControl/slm_display.py, and it'll appear.
