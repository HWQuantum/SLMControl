*** DONE Add in a saving/loading function
   - this could be a right click context menu - right click on any widget to set the defaults/save a set
*** DONE Add in the ability to change the lookup table at more points
   - Make a list where more widgets can be added
   - Maybe show the LUT on a little plot
